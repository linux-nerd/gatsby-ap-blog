# Motivation

Few weeks back I tried to create a browser extension as a lab's day project. The idea was to ease the development experience, like filling up a long form for testing purpose or add/remove features without changing the user. Although I was not able to complete it in two day's time, but I gained some insight which may help folks who are new to it.

# Why Browser Extension

My sole purpose was to ease the developer/tester experience by providing an extra interface to tweak the behaviour of the application, but there are a lot of interesting things that can be done with browser extensions. But before coming to benefits, let's see what are browser extensions.

## What are Browser Extension

An extension adds features and functions to a browser. It’s created using familiar web-based technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and has its own set of APIs. This means it can leverage all the existing APIs and has access to all new Extension APIs. A great power boost.

## Benefits

* Enhance or complement a website
* Add theme to all websites a user visits
* Add/Remove content from web page (AdBlocker)
