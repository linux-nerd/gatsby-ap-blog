description: Configure React from ground up using Webpack and Babel

# Introduction
The easiest and the most effective way to write react code is to spin up a dev environment via [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I bet everyone who is into React development has used `create react app`. The best and the worst thing about **CRA** is `abstraction`. It abstracts away the details which is required for the setup. For some one new to react, its heaven as that person can solely focus on learning react. For a seasoned/senior developer, it makes more sense to know how the setup works. In this post, I will setup the dev environment for react from ground up using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
